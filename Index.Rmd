## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library("readxl")
# xls files
my_data <- read_excel("C:/Users/14252/Desktop/ACI_Sealevels_monthly_smoothed.xlsx", sheet = 1)
my_data
library(ggplot2)
library(directlabels)
my_data<-data.frame(my_data)
pica <- ggplot(data=my_data, aes(x = Months, y = change))+ 
  geom_point(aes(color = Station))+
  geom_dl(aes(label=Station),method="last.points")+
  ylim(-4,4)+
  xlim(0,800)+
  labs(title = "Sea level change in Millimeters, from January of 1969 to Febuary of 2022",
       subtitle = "Plot of 5 different Regions", 
       caption = "Data source: Actuary Climate Index",
       y = "Change in Millimeters of Sea level from base(1969)",
       x = "Total months (starting from 1969 to Febuary of 2022)" )
 pica
print(pica)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
